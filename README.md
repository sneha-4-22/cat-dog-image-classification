## Overview

This project implements a machine learning model for classifying images as either cats or dogs. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a dataset of cat and dog images.

## Features

- Image classification into two categories: cats and dogs.
- Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the CNN.
- Includes data augmentation for improved model performance.

## Getting Started
